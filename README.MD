### ADBDroid.json

## This is a custom driver for NEEO to allow ADB over Meta.
It can be installed as a regular driver by putting ADBDroid.json in the active folder of meta 
(see https://github.com/jac459/meta).

It uses one (1) module that is not delivered within meta from JAC459, namely PythonManager.py.
See my supplemental meta repository for information on its functions and how to install.
